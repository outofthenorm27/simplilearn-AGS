# Personal Expense Tracker (Beginner Python Project)

This CLI app teaches Python **while** you build a practical tool:

- **Data Types & Assignment:** lists, dicts, floats/ints, strings, booleans
- **Operators:** arithmetic (+, +=), comparison (> < ==), logical (and/or/not)
- **Strings:** `.strip()`, `.title()`, `.lower()`, f-strings, alignment
- **File Handling:** CSV read/write with `csv`, text files, `Path.exists()`
- **Error Handling:** `try/except/else/finally`, validation, friendly messages

## Run It

```bash
python expense_tracker.py
```

Your data will be saved in `expenses.csv`. The latest budget (if set) is stored in `budget.txt`.

## Tips for Instructors
- Encourage students to **intentionally break things** (bad dates, negative amounts) to see validation and error handling in action.
- Ask them to add a feature: e.g., filter by date range, export category totals, or edit/delete an expense.
